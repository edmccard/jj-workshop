Perhaps you've heard of the JJ VCS, a new VCS replacing git that makes commit discipline and dealing with stacked PRs a breeze. Perhaps you've read the same blog posts I have, about how great jj is and how easy it is to get started.

But it wasn't enough for me, and it might not be enough for you. I felt my productivity grind to a halt as I struggled with things that had become second nature after 15 years of using git. Even though I was told it would be easy, I dreaded for days the prospect of dealing with my first merge conflict.

But then I hit jj heaven, and my productivity reached new heights. If only I'd had first gotten to do deliberate practice of the major workflows, I would have gotten there much faster.

I created this workshop to save the rest of my team --- and now the rest of the world --- from the same learning pains I went through learning JJ.

This is not yet another blog post about the awesomeness of jj.  It's a series of exercises -- done in simulation in this tiny repo -- to give you experience with all the major version-control workflows as fast as possible.
